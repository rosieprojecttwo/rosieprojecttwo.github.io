	Uh Oh, be careful! Miquela is <i>not</i> human!
</h2>

<p>
	The rise of social media has shaken our notion of online identities. 

Miquela Sous is an ‘influencer’ on Instagram who has accumulated over 1.4 million followers. On first look, Miquela might look like most other millennial Instagram influencers, tagging her posts with fast fashion brands and posting holiday pictures from LA. However, on closer looks, it becomes clear that she does not exist beyond Instagram’s one dimension. Miquela is a product of CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery), digital designers inserting her computer-generated image alongside LA socialites in posts sponsored by trending fashion brands.
<br> <br>
Miquela blurs the line between what we perceive as reality within the social media sphere, forcing us to question how we construct our online identities. Miquela accumulated 800,000 followers before revealing she is computer generated by posting glammed up selfies in trending outfits no different to other Instagram influencers.  This forces us to ask <br>ourselves, how real are the online identities of human Instagram influencers if Miquela can pass as ‘real’?  And if  <br>Miquela is not real, does this make human instagram influencers fake? This dichotomy between reality and <br>fabrication reveals just how fake Instagram really is, and here lies the problem, because we perceive <br>it as reality. 
<br> <br>
We are now living in a world of representations. Miquela is not imitating a human, she is imitating a <br> representation of a human. These flattened representations of ideal realities are filling up our <br>news feed daily, acting as ideal (however, unattainable) epitomes that pre-teens through <br> to adults aspire to be.  Miquela, being fake while still flourishing in the social media world<br> and blending in amongst other Instagram stars, forces us to hold a mirror to our <br>perceptions and constructions of online identities in the two dimensional <br>social media realm.
